# Longest Common Substring Finder

This program finds the **longest contiguous common substring** between two input strings. It uses a brute-force approach to compare all starting positions between the strings and tracks the longest match.

---

## Problem Description

Given two input strings, the program determines the longest segment that appears **contiguously** and **identically** in both.

---

## How It Works

- The user provides two input strings via standard input.
- The program compares all possible starting positions in both strings.
- For every match found, it checks how far the match continues.
- The longest match found is reported.

## Input Format

The program expects two strings (max length 10,000) entered one after the other:
